# Jupyter Notebook Repository

Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook repository! This repository is organized into four main folders, each containing different projects and learning materials related to data science and machine learning. Below is a brief overview of each folder and its contents.

## Folders

### 1. Machine Learning
This folder contains my progressions in learning machine learning. Here are some key highlights:

- **Notes on Machine Learning:** Basic concepts and code snippets to understand machine learning.
- **Neural Network for Repressilator Gene Expression:** A neural network built to predict the repressilator gene expression network.
- **Neural Network Class:** Custom-built neural network class.
- **FFN Class Prediction:** Using the FFN class to predict a stochastic model (Gillespie) of the repressilator.

I am particularly proud of the work in this folder, especially the neural network projects.

### 2. P1_models
This folder contains my initial models related to the repressilator system and other biochemical kinetics. Key files include:

- **Repressilator Models:** Gillespie method and deterministic model using a system of ODEs.
- **Michaelis-Menten Models:** Enzyme kinetics models.
- **Ligand Binding Models:** Models of ligand-receptor interactions.
- **Monod Kinetics Models:** Models for microbial growth kinetics.

### 3. P2_regression
This folder is where I explored and learned about regression techniques. It contains various notebooks and projects focused on understanding and applying regression methods.

### 4. Pandas
Currently, this folder is empty, but it is intended for developing and showcasing my skills using the Pandas library. Future projects and exercises using Pandas will be stored here.
